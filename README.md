# Modelling-of-three-phase-Induction-motor-using-Python-Sympy
This repository includes Python and Matlab codes for modeling of a three-phase induction motor using SymPy symbolic math library. The modeling includes codes for modeling of the motor in an arbitrary rotating dq0 reference frame using reference frame transformation matrix concept and space phasor concept.
